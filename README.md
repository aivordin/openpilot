# Hardcoded Fingerprint openpilot Installer Helper

This GitHub repository continuouslly generates openpilot branches with hardcoded fingerprints for the purpose of installing openpilot on un-fingerprinted or under-fingerprinted vehicles.

This should be considered a temporary solution until the official openpilot repository is updated with the necessary fingerprints. At which point, you should switch back to the official openpilot code.

See this generated file for a list of vehicles and the corresponding installer URL:

TODO: Add a link to the generated file.

## Other Forks

This is generally not necessary for other forks as many of them have selectors. It is only necessary for openpilot codebases without selectors such as comma's official openpilot.
