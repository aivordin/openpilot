# Hardcoded Fingerprint comma.ai openpilot Installer Helper

This GitHub repository continuously generates openpilot branches off of `release3` and `master-ci` with hardcoded fingerprints for the purpose of installing comma.ai openpilot on un-fingerprinted vehicles.

This should be considered a temporary solution until the official openpilot repository is updated with the necessary fingerprints. At which point, the user should switch back to the official openpilot code.

You can see the branches generated by this repository here:

## Custom Forks

This is generally not necessary for other forks as many of them have vehicle selectors. This is only useful for openpilot codebases without selectors such as comma's official openpilot.

## Why not dynamically generate the installer and inject the fingerprint?

Injecting the fingerprint with the installer may produce orphaned commits or non-commited code that can only be found on the device itself. By producing these branches periodically with GitHub, the commit on the device will have a commit in GitHub that can be referenced.
